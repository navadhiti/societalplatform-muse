Each of these platforms makes our lives a little easier by connecting us with people, services, and products that we need in our day to day lives.</p>\n<p style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 30px; letter-spacing: 0.3px; font-size: 1.25rem; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;\">Such Platforms are operating models that create value by facilitating exchanges between two or more interdependent groups, usually consumers and producers. In order to make these exchanges happen, platforms build and harness large, scalable networks of users and resources that can be accessed on-demand, thus meeting our needs of entertainment, healthcare, logistics, and beyond.</p>\n<p style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 30px; letter-spacing: 0.3px; font-size: 1.25rem; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;\">But not all platforms are the same, they also differ on the basis of how they empower their users by sharing data with them and by providing services that can enable agency of different stakeholders. Along these lines,&nbsp;platforms can be of two types:&nbsp;<em style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat;\">Private Platforms</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat;\">Platforms for public service</em>. The major difference that lies between the two is &#8211;&nbsp;<em style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat;\">Intent</em>.&nbsp;For example,&nbsp;a platform that provides access to knowledge or process resources or tools to create the different types of resources without subscription barriers etc. can be considered a&nbsp;<em style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat;\">platform for public use</em>, whereas platforms where barriers to access, such as paywalls, exist, are private platforms.&nbsp;Let’s understand how each kind of platform works.</p>\n<p style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 30px; letter-spacing: 0.3px; font-size: 1.25rem; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;\">First, there are&nbsp;Private Platforms&nbsp;that facilitate development, deployment, and operations on privately owned infrastructure or behind a protected firewall. These platforms provide many interactions among consumers and providers that allow them to get services/ products in exchange for money or access to their data. Private platforms include the likes of Google, Uber, Zomato, Tinder, etc. where these platforms also allow users to access a substantial amount of their own data but at the same time, manage the interactions in the ecosystem through the insights that the user behavior data provide.</p>\n<p style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 30px; letter-spacing: 0.3px; font-size: 1.25rem; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;\">For example, Uber is a ride-hailing platform that provides on-demand cab services. It is virtually a free service that connects passengers to drivers. However, in the course of providing this service, the platform requests for and gains access to our personal information such as email IDs, location, preferable modes of payment, etc, which they eventually use to design customised ad experiences for every individual user, as per the company policies. The customer-behaviour data also feeds into other initiatives that the company can design to provide other services such as food delivery, package delivery, etc.</p>\n<p style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 30px; letter-spacing: 0.3px; font-size: 1.25rem; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, we have the other type of platforms:&nbsp;<em style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat;\">Platforms for public service</em>&nbsp;also called&nbsp;Societal Platforms.&nbsp;Societal Platforms are created with the intention of serving the public for societal good with the focus of ownership by the different key actors in the ecosystem rather than one company/ corporation. These platforms can be publicly owned by NGOs or government institutions to address various societal challenges and they empower their users with data, nurture development within their ecosystem and connect problem solvers to each other. Societal platforms address issues in a not for profit manner purely for the benefit of the society rather than focusing on increasing profit margins.</p>\n<style>/*! elementor - v3.5.3 - 28-12-2021 */<br />\n.elementor-widget-image{text-align:center}.elementor-widget-image a{display:inline-block}.elementor-widget-image a img[src$=\".svg\"]{width:48px}.elementor-widget-image img{vertical-align:middle;display:inline-block}</style>\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"436\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/table-1024x436.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/table-1024x436.png 1024w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/table-300x128.png 300w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/table-768x327.png 768w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/table.png 1221w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></p>\n<p style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 30px; letter-spacing: 0.3px; font-size: 1.25rem; color: #4a4a4a; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;\"><em style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat;\">Table 1: Differences between Private and Societal Platforms&nbsp;</em><em style=\"font-size: 1.25rem; letter-spacing: 0.3px; background-repeat: no-repeat;\">across different parameters</em></p>\n<p>If one is designing a tool with a societal outcome in mind, such as, dignity, choice, and agency for the most underserved people, the interplay between government (<em>sarkaa</em>r) , civil society (<em>samaaj</em>), and markets (<em>bazaar</em>) &nbsp;and the unique roles that they play become very evident. This is where societal platforms come into the picture where the interactions are designed such that it enables collaboration, co-creation, and approach to scale between each of the actors.</p>\n<p>Both kinds of platforms hold importance in our society and cater to different end goals, however, they operate with different value systems. The values with which the Societal Platforms operate can be broadly termed as Societal Platform Core Values.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://societalplatform.org/the-idea/the-aspiration/\">The Societal Platform Core Values are:</a></p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"386\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image1-1024x386.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image1-1024x386.png 1024w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image1-300x113.png 300w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image1-768x289.png 768w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image1.png 1166w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></p>\n<p><a style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; background-color: #ffffff; touch-action: manipulation; color: var(--link-color); text-decoration-line: underline; transition-property: color; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: 0.3px;\" href=\"https://societalplatform.org/the-idea/the-aspiration/\"><em style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat;\">Image Source : Societal Platform</em></a></p>\n<p>How is ShikshaLokam a Societal Platform?</p>\n<p style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 30px; letter-spacing: 0.3px; font-size: 1.25rem; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;\"><a style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; touch-action: manipulation; color: var(--primary-foreground-color); text-decoration-line: underline; transition-property: color;\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QyfrJKRn7I\"><em style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat;\">ShikshaLokam</em></a>&nbsp;is an education leadership platform that aims to enable and amplify leadership development opportunities for individuals and institutions engaged in K-12 education systems. ShikshaLokam connects different stakeholders in the education system with a mission of transforming school leadership including civil society organisations, government institutions and changemakers in the education sector to co-create solutions to complex societal problems at scale.</p>\n<ul style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; letter-spacing: 0.3px; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1.25rem; padding-left: 40px; margin-bottom: 30px; margin-left: 0px; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;\">\n<li style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; margin-bottom: 20px;\">ShikshaLokam aspires to restore the agency of the first-mile users: the education leaders, by making solutions accessible to them and by providing them access to their own data. The platform is&nbsp;not for profit-making. All the resources and capabilities of&nbsp;<a style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; touch-action: manipulation; color: var(--primary-foreground-color); text-decoration-line: underline; transition-property: color;\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV2NFhlrK30\"><em style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat;\">Bodh&nbsp;</em></a>&#8211; To Learn,&nbsp;<em style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat;\">Samiksha&nbsp;</em>&#8211; To sense and make sense, and&nbsp;<a style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; touch-action: manipulation; color: var(--primary-foreground-color); text-decoration-line: underline; transition-property: color;\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51eo9Bc7J5Y\"><em style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat;\">Unnati</em></a>&nbsp;-To Improve, available on the platform are&nbsp;open-source&nbsp;and are available free of cost.</li>\n<li style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; margin-bottom: 20px;\">To amplify leadership development opportunities for individuals and institutions engaged in education systems, ShikshaLokam&nbsp;connects different actors&nbsp;working towards this cause to co-create solutions and implement them. This is done by enabling NGOs, CSOs, government officials to&nbsp;imagine and implement their programs at scale. ShikshaLokam works in close partnership with its key partners to co-create solutions on the platform for different needs of the first-mile users. All the partner organisations, institutions and State Education Departments that run their programs through ShikshaLokam get&nbsp;access to relevant data and key insights&nbsp;of their initiatives in order to make informed decisions and measure the impact of their programs. These data insights empower partners to be better informed about the complexity of the problem that they are dealing with and come up with efficient solutions accordingly.</li>\n<li style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; margin-bottom: 20px;\">Ecosystem partners are highly encouraged to reuse existing solutions on the ShikshaLokam platform as part of their programs. Various organisations also co-create programs and the related solutions and assets together on the ShikshaLokam platform. The School Leadership Development Program (SLDP) in the State of Uttar Pradesh is an example of a program co-created with the UP state officials in collaboration with partner organisations.</li>\n<li style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; margin-bottom: 20px;\">Along with that, the technology on which the infrastructure is built is also open source. This allows for people to take the code pieces developed through the platform creation journey and create further sophisticated tech-based solutions on top of the Platform as per the context and need. ShikshaLokam was built on top of the open-source infrastructure called Sunbird, and now ShikshaLokam has extended and built newer capabilities and has contributed them back to Sunbird. Diksha &#8211; a national education platform by MoE is also able to leverage these new capabilities at a national scale.</li>\n<li style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; margin-bottom: 20px;\">ShikshaLokam keeps the&nbsp;<a style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; touch-action: manipulation; color: var(--primary-foreground-color); text-decoration-line: underline; transition-property: color;\" href=\"https://space.societalplatform.org/viewer/pdf/lex_auth_01305898553257164883?viewMode=RESUME\">Societal Platform Model</a>&nbsp;at the core of its operation. The attempt is always to design the assets in form of knowledge, processes, technology, connections and data in a manner that makes them reusable, interoperable and generic. This ensures that assets can be easily dispersed to more actors and organisations that feel the need for it. &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 30px; letter-spacing: 0.3px; font-size: 1.25rem; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;\">Societal platforms such as Shikshalokam, enable co-creation of solutions, opportunities for collaboration and most importantly access to data that the entire system and government and civil society benefit from. ShikshaLokam is a platform that anyone working in the space of education leadership can work with, is completely free, and is legally available to all, and hence promotes and encourages public goods creation, co-creation and collaboration to achieve scale at speed.</p>\n",

Much necessary attributes to drive people towards achievement, especially during uncertain times &#8211; such as the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our team connected to Mr. Rajesh a few days ago to find out how he is running the capacity building initiatives to make the teachers in the Kanpur district Prerak teachers &#8211; a source of inspiration for the entire ecosystem. And we were left in awe of him and his efforts.</p>\n<p>Last year, the schools shutdown due to the pandemic and the teachers had to turn to online teaching platforms. But most of them were hesitant as they lacked the technical know-how. In order to overcome this dilemma, Mr. Rajesh formed an expert team consisting of 11 members that conducted ICT workshops to train teachers to help them get accustomed to Google meet, Zoom, MS Word, excel, powerpoint applications on their devices. Eventually, teachers overcame their fear of using technology, and built confidence to learn and teach online. They even put together a magazine (glimpse below) about the ICT project after developing these capabilities.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"811\" height=\"755\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Newspaper-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Newspaper-1.jpeg 811w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Newspaper-1-300x279.jpeg 300w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Newspaper-1-768x715.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 811px) 100vw, 811px\"></p>\n<p><strong>Feedback from the participants of ICT workshop</strong></p>\n<p>Mr. Rajesh sensed the challenges for the teachers, made sense of what is required to overcome the barriers &#8211; technical, device accessibility, mindset related, etc., brought people together to conduct the workshops and set the teachers on the path to learn and improve their capabilities. He impressed upon the teachers that the usage of technology is to support them and help them teach better, not to replace them with it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b><i>“It is not teachers vs technology, but teachers with technology</i></b><i>.”&nbsp;</i></p>\n<p>This year, when new learning programs were launched, the objective was to achieve a 100% completion rate. The challenge was to monitor and identify the teachers/ schools who have completed a course and those who haven’t. Mr. Rajesh and his team created a communication network covering all stakeholders from school level to NPRC (Nyaay Panchayat Resource Coordinator), to Block and to District level. The teachers and school teams which completed the courses were recognised while those who struggled, were provided assistance through Technical Support Group as necessary. The increased comfort with technology resulted in 70% teachers completing the course of their own accord, within the timeline.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As an effective leader, Mr. Rajesh regularly applies the approach of sense, make sense, learn and improve in order to solve more problems on the ground. Says Rekha Srivastava, District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) Principal from Kanpur division, “I connected with him a year ago and have been impressed by his original thoughts to solve problems. He focuses on initiatives that actually bring change in the ecosystem. Determined to bring improvements, he sets the targets, draws a plan, identifying the stakeholders across all levels and motivates them non stop. ”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mr. Rajesh and his team regularly collects feedback from the teachers to understand challenges faced by the teachers. Recently, making sense of the barriers, teachers workshops were held with experts to boost their morale and on how to manage stress. Mr. Rajesh himself motivated teachers during Shiksha Sankul Meetings, to focus on the tasks with gusto.</p>\n<p><b><i>He motivated the teachers by highlighting that the goal is not the target, but giving their 100%, which automatically achieves the target.&nbsp;</i></b></p>\n<p>If you are low on motivation, if you are stuck and want to brainstorm solutions or just want to understand how to motivate the team, Mr. Rajesh is the go-to-leader. Indeed a privilege working with him.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>He says, <b><i>“संघर्ष किसका कितना है परिणाम बोलेगा, मैं नहीं बोलूँगा मेरा काम बोलेगा</i></b><b> &#8211; </b><b><i>the measure of the struggle is reflected in the results, not the words, but my work exults.”</i></b></p>\n",

These are introduced in society to generate benefits for all. Unlike private goods, public goods are inherently available in abundance and offered at minimal to no cost to individuals. The two main criteria</h5>\n<p><strong>Public goods put simply are commodities and services that are made available to all members of society.</strong> These are introduced in society to generate benefits for all. Unlike private goods, public goods are inherently available in abundance and offered at minimal to no cost to individuals. The two main criteria that distinguish public goods are that they must be non-rivalrous and non-excludable. Non-rivalrous means that the goods do not dwindle in supply as more people consume them and non-excludability means that the goods are available to all citizens. Public goods have the potential of generating economic and social benefits that outweigh their costs. This offers as a strong motivation for changemakers to think and outline ways to imagine their ideas to take the form of public goods.</p>\n<p>When we explore public goods further, especially in the context of education and educational leadership, we realise that the term ‘public goods’ has many layers to it. Once we understand these layers, making assets such as knowledge, processes, data, and technology freely available to everyone then becomes an insightful and productive quest.</p>\n<p><strong>In Week 5 of the Cerebration Series, participants came together to delve deeper into the meaning of public goods in the context of educational leadership and to unravel efforts that can be taken to design resources with the focus on building public goods</strong>. The experience also included a ‘Design Challenge’ wherein the community was able to apply its understanding and have an open discussion around questions that came up during the process.</p>\n<h5>Public Goods as part of Societal Platform Model</h5>\n<p>Different organisations identify the complex societal problem piece that they wish to solve. To do so, they formulate their <strong>MISSION</strong> which is then imagined in the form of multiple <strong>PROGRAMS</strong>. For any particular program, there can be <strong>SOLUTIONS</strong> linked to it that address the problem that it intends to solve. Solutions further take the form of byte-sized resources identified as <strong>ASSETS</strong>. These assets can be in the form of <strong>knowledge, processes, technology, connections and data</strong>. When these assets are designed in manners that make them <strong>reusable, interoperable and generic</strong>, it leads to the generation of public goods by the organisation. The entire process involves unbundling programs into smaller pieces of resources which can further be rebundled as public goods that fosters co-creation and network effects. This entire cycle pushes organisations to be empathetic, generous and conscious of designing assets in an unbundled generic way so that they can be made available for the use of others.</p>\n<h5>Characteristics of Public Goods</h5>\n<p>In the process of building public goods, it becomes important to begin by articulating what public goods mean. To build that knowledge, our participants tried identifying characteristics of assets they create as public goods. These are certain common characteristics that emerged:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reusable:</strong> The assets created are available to be reutilized by users and can easily be adopted in context to their respective programs</li>\n<li><strong>Accessible:</strong> The assets are easily, readily and abundantly available in the society</li>\n<li><strong>Interoperable:</strong> The assets can be shared without any restriction and can easily be hosted across different software and processes</li>\n<li><strong>Affordable:</strong> In order to use these assets, the users bear minimum to no cost</li>\n<li><strong>Simple:</strong> These assets are designed in simple language and structure so that they can easily be comprehended by the users</li>\n<li><strong>Solution-oriented:</strong> These assets are designed in order to address and solve a societal problem</li>\n</ul>\n<style>/*! elementor - v3.5.3 - 28-12-2021 */\n.elementor-widget-image{text-align:center}.elementor-widget-image a{display:inline-block}.elementor-widget-image a img[src$=\".svg\"]{width:48px}.elementor-widget-image img{vertical-align:middle;display:inline-block}</style>\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"873\" height=\"426\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pasted-image-4.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pasted-image-4.png 873w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pasted-image-4-300x146.png 300w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pasted-image-4-768x375.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 873px) 100vw, 873px\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Participants identify characteristics of Public Goods (1)</p>\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"815\" height=\"472\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pasted-image-1-1.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pasted-image-1-1.png 815w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pasted-image-1-1-300x174.png 300w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pasted-image-1-1-768x445.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 815px) 100vw, 815px\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Participants identify characteristics of Public Goods (2)</p>\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"805\" height=\"485\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pasted-image-2-1.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pasted-image-2-1.png 805w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pasted-image-2-1-300x181.png 300w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/pasted-image-2-1-768x463.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Participants identify characteristics of Public Goods (3)</p>\n<h5>Design Challenge</h5>\n<p>To experience the thought process that goes behind ultimately designing a public good, our participants engaged in a design challenge. <strong>The task that lay ahead was to design a knowledge asset: a toolkit as a public good in the context of a state-run school leadership development program (SLDP).</strong> The group of participants brainstormed on identifying key points that would constitute the toolkit to address given problem statements.

In the context of education, multiple interactions between children, parents, educators, state officials and many more stakeholders are responsible for producing the result that we see today. For changemakers, interactions with stakeholders form an integral part of understanding context, designing relevant programs and improving the effectiveness of these programs. Interactions fill us with wisdom and therefore, they are essential in fuelling actions that lead to solutions for complex societal problems. Understanding the role of interactions in depth thus becomes important in our journey of problem-solving.</p>\n<p>However, most often, these interactions are difficult to make sense primarily due to the absence of linearity in them. The school education system in itself has multiple actors at different levels and when these actors<em> </em>begin interacting with each other, we see the emergence of an intensive web that contains many simultaneous, parallel and dependent interactions. For example, a Cluster Resource Person might be interacting with many Headmasters under them and the number of interactions keeps getting multiplied as more actors like Block Resource Persons, Block Education Officers etc. come into the picture.</p>\n<p>In Week 3 of the Cerebration Series, ShikshaLokam along with the participants from different organizations came together to understand the role of interactions in the context of the different actors that we work with as well as in the context of their lived realities. We all learnt a new approach towards unravelling complex interactions that we work in and share key experiences with the group to learn from each other not only from where we stand as change catalysts but from the perspective of the stakeholders themselves.</p>\n<h5>Stories of ‘Memorable Interaction’</h5>\n<p>The session started with participants <strong>sharing a memorable interaction that they most recently had with a stakeholder</strong>. They further shared what made the interaction memorable for them &#8211; the particular actions that the stakeholder did that made the interaction memorable for them.</p>\n<p>The participants recollected their memories of interactions which included instances of working alongside a visionary education department stakeholder, witnessing supportive stakeholders that enabled growth in their team members and more, and many more. During this engagement, a realisation that emerged was that identifying the instance of interaction, in the form of an activity was quite easy, however there was some struggle in defining what the  “interaction” was around the activity.</p>\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"601\" height=\"503\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Memorable-Interactions-with-stakeholders-1-1.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Memorable-Interactions-with-stakeholders-1-1.png 601w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Memorable-Interactions-with-stakeholders-1-1-300x251.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Memorable Interactions with stakeholders (1)</p>\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"507\" height=\"419\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Memorable-Interactions-with-stakeholders-2-1.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Memorable-Interactions-with-stakeholders-2-1.png 507w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Memorable-Interactions-with-stakeholders-2-1-300x248.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Memorable Interactions with stakeholders (2) </p>\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"872\" height=\"399\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Memorable-Interactions-with-stakeholders-3-1.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Memorable-Interactions-with-stakeholders-3-1.png 872w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Memorable-Interactions-with-stakeholders-3-1-300x137.png 300w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Memorable-Interactions-with-stakeholders-3-1-768x351.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 872px) 100vw, 872px\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Memorable Interactions with stakeholders (3) </p>\n<h5>Catalysing Interactions: Network Mapping Approach</h5>\n<p>It is our interactions with others that lead us to outcomes every day. In the context of the education sector, the interactions that occur between diverse stakeholders: students, parents, teachers, HMs, state officials and so forth are the interactions that eventually lead to student outcomes. In order to bring forth systemic improvements, it becomes necessary to familiarize ourselves with what these interactions within the system are. To practice the approach of understanding these ‘actors’ and ‘actions’ in the system, our participants engaged in a ‘Design Challenge’ wherein they took on the role of NGO actors and identified the networks that emerge in a state-run school leadership development program (SLDP). The exercise primarily revolved around participants attempting to answer the following prompts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Who are the stakeholders that we want to work with?</li>\n<li>What are the enabling interactions between them?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Throughout this, the participants focused on identifying interactions relevant to their program while also identifying the aspirational interactions important in running the program at scale.</p>\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"902\" height=\"521\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Network-Mapping-1.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Network-Mapping-1.png 902w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Network-Mapping-1-300x173.png 300w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Network-Mapping-1-768x444.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Network Mapping approach in action: participants identify desirous interaction within the system</p>\n<h5>Key reflections</h5>\n<p>The key to reaching an aspirational or desired interaction between stakeholders lie in identifying what changes can make the interactions between them more empathetic and enabling &#8211; these can be changes in dynamics of the interactions, identifying what barriers need to be overcome and the innovations that can be introduced. Co-creating the outlook and building a shared vision can prove to be instrumental in laying down foundations for desirous interactions. When it comes to identifying means that strengthen an interaction, one must be conscious of introducing means that add value for all actors involved in this interaction during the course of strengthening.</p>\n<p>Along with interaction among diverse actors, there are also numerous kinds of interactions that tend to occur namely &#8211; interactions around capacity building, sharing of resources, data analysis and reporting that often add to the complexity of interactions within the system. Interactions are dynamic and can quickly change based on the decisions happening on the nodes (actors).</p>\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"859\" height=\"501\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Actors-and-Interactions-1-2.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Actors-and-Interactions-1-2.png 859w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Actors-and-Interactions-1-2-300x175.png 300w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Actors-and-Interactions-1-2-768x448.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Actors and Interactions (1) </p>\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"726\" height=\"518\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Actors-and-Interactions-2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Actors-and-Interactions-2-1.jpg 726w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Actors-and-Interactions-2-1-300x214.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Actors and Interactions (2) </p>\n<p>As the session concluded, the discussion served as an important reminder that the onus of restoring agency and designing programs such that agency is restored, at scale, does not solely depend on one single entity or an actor but numerous interactions that occur between several stakeholders on different occasions and on designing interactions in a way that agency of the stakeholders is always restored and not taken away from them. Therefore, paying close attention to existing interactions in our programs becomes vital for its scale and sustenance, so that we can design for generating value in the existing ones and to be able to design newer better interactions.</p>\n<p>Have you engaged in or witnessed any interaction that was memorable for you?

ShikshaLokam, in its journey has constantly engaged with the actors, either to pick brains on what kind of engagement would the stakeholders find more personalized and agency-driven, or to brainstorm on what it means to design programs for education leadership at scale, to name a few. There have been collaborations that have led to the creation of a community of practitioners  who have tried and tested different methods of enabling education leadership at scale. However, no matter which first-mile stakeholder we work with, we realized, that, as a community &#8212; many common challenges surround us, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>how do we make technology easy for our leaders,</li>\n<li>how do we know if what we are designing is leading to any shift,</li>\n<li>how do we collaborate with <em>sarkaar</em>,</li>\n<li>why certain solutions are more effective than others!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To find answers to these questions and more, ShikshaLokam initiated a space to find common meaning about what it means to apply platform thinking for education leadership at scale, with this community.</p>\n<p>We kickstarted the space with <strong>Introduction to the Societal Platform Core Values</strong> to all the participants. Different groups representing a mix of organizations discussed <strong>their understanding of the platform values </strong>and shared their experiences of having seen these values get manifested in their personal and professional journeys as a change maker. Here is a peek into the highlights of what was shared:</p>\n<h4>Restore Agency</h4>\n<p>Access to information, ability to choose, trust from others and the power to decide form the core of being able to exercise <em>agency</em> for self. Although one might also not be able to exercise their agency due to multiple reasons such as lack of information and trust, to ignite the practice, one can be taken on the journey of “guided agency”. This is where the role of a<em> samaj</em> actor comes into the picture as they can help the stakeholders on this journey of discovering and then exercising their agency in a guided manner. If a stakeholder says “no” to an idea or an intervention, this should also be  taken as an indication of them practicing their agency by participating in the change process.</p>\n<h4>Catalyse Interactions</h4>\n<p>Fostering interactions among stakeholders is key. To catalyze interactions, what value is exchanged in an interaction should be focused. Acknowledging that one does not always have a solution and that evoking interactions can help is a mindset that one should adopt. Solving can’t be done in silos- they have to happen in a connected environment where individual strengths come together. Peer learning communities have shown catalyzed interactions where the voice of the learners gets heard which aids further opening of interactions. Civil society organizations play the role of catalysts who create opportunities for interactions. Either existing interactions to be made better or new interactions can be designed. Defining the scope of interactions right from the start might be helpful as that will make sure that the revised interactions are nudges to move to a new state and not a complete disruption of processes.</p>\n<h4>Building Public Goods</h4>\n<p>Building goods that are scarce and making it available through easy access is what building public goods stands for. If the goods that are being created are open to the public for reuse and reconstruction, it can be called a public good. In the context of education and education leadership, the resources created in the form of learning materials, training materials, program designs and others are examples of public goods. The mindset to create for use and reuse by others is the backbone of the value of building public goods.</p>\n<h4>Inspire Co-creation</h4>\n<p>Co-creation in the context of education means co-creating with the stakeholders themselves right from the start. The stakeholders can be representatives from different layers of the system, but including them in the space and  further creating spaces where they can co-create among themselves is the essence of this value. Co-creation practices are most sustainable and also builds more ownership in the participants themselves to carry out the actions post the co-creation exercise. Examples where this value has been seen manifested in programs running in the state of Bihar where different civil society organizations came together to design the school leadership development program in the State while also including the members of the state in the design process. Additionally in the state of Madhya Pradesh, where the state worked on re-engineering the process of leave application in the system, they included the officials at the block level and district level to share their inputs on how this process can be made better.</p>\n<h4>Empower with Data</h4>\n<p>Access to data is part of empowering with data, but the ability to make sense of the data and imagine ways in which the data can be useful to drive is the core of empowering through data. A lot of times we and our stakeholders do have access to data, but whether it is easy to understand or not determines the usability of that data too. So empowering with data includes all aspects related to access to data, ability to make sense and how to include it in action as well. In the context of programs, stakeholders do have access to data as they are involved in a lot of data collection processes, but how can this data influence their ability to make decisions and take actions is the core of where we need to focus when it comes to empowering through data.</p>\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"639\" height=\"339\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Word-Cloud-of-Participants.jpeg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Word-Cloud-of-Participants.jpeg 639w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Word-Cloud-of-Participants-1-300x159.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Word Cloud of Participants’ responses on what do they understand by &#8220;Applying Platform Thinking for Education Leadership&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the spirit of co-creation, ShikshaLokam and the Societal Platform team came together to design a space where we can together create tangible meaning of societal platform thinking with our partners. We aim to uncover deeper meanings as we go further in this space.</p>\n<p>The reflections from each group ended with the question of “which value do you resonate the most with” and what it is that they think of when they think of applying platform thinking for education leadership. We would like to know from you too.. Which value do you resonate the most with… share with us!</p>\n<h2>Tags</h2>\n<h2>Recommended for you</h2>\n<article>\n                        <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/20/voices-of-cerebration-exploring-interactions-in-the-system/\"></a><br />\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Carving-Featued-images-1-300x144.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<header>\n<h2><a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/20/voices-of-cerebration-exploring-interactions-in-the-system/\" title=\"Carving Opportunities in Crises\">Carving Opportunities in Crises</a></h2>\n</header>\n<p>                    <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/author/shikshalokam/\" title=\"Posts by ShikshaLokam\" rel=\"author\">ShikshaLokam</a><time datetime=\"May 20, 2021\">May 20, 2021</time><br />\n    </article>\n<article>\n                        <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/20/how-can-schools-use-data/\"></a><br />\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/How-can-Schools-use-Data-1-300x170.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<header>\n<h2><a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/20/how-can-schools-use-data/\" title=\"How can Schools use Data\">How can Schools use Data</a></h2>\n</header>\n<p>                    <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/author/shikshalokam/\" title=\"Posts by ShikshaLokam\" rel=\"author\">ShikshaLokam</a><time datetime=\"May 20, 2021\">May 20, 2021</time><br />\n    </article>\n<article>\n                        <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/07/why-school-leadership-matters/\"></a><br />\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Why-School-Leadership-Matters-300x187.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<header>\n<h2><a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/07/why-school-leadership-matters/\" title=\"Why School Leadership Matters\">Why School Leadership Matters</a></h2>\n</header>\n<p>                    <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/author/shikshalokam/\" title=\"Posts by ShikshaLokam\" rel=\"author\">ShikshaLokam</a><time datetime=\"May 7, 2021\">May 7, 2021</time><br />\n    </article>\n",

Exercising agency takes different forms in our day-to-day lives. It could be us attending a learning session that we have long been wanting to do,  or it could be us being able to mute our social media to focus on work and mental peace..no matter what shape or form it takes, having the ability to say a yes or a no to what we feel will help us to reach a better state is what agency essentially boils down to. You might agree with me that whenever decisions and actions are driven by agency, and not fear, there is a lot more ownership towards the actions and the results are a lot better.  </p>\n<p>In reality however there are a lot of factors that affect a person’s ability to exercise their agency. And for everyone to equally be able to exercise their agency is also a challenge because of the unique power dynamics that exist at the level of every individual.</p>\n<p>ShikshaLokam as a societal platform mission aims to enable education leadership at scale. One of the core values of this thinking is the value of restoring agency of all our stakeholders, as it is only then that every stakeholder will be able to emerge as a leader. However, what does restoring agency at scale look like, how can we design for <em>restoring agency</em>&#8230; These were some of the questions that we attempted to answer together with our participant learners in the second session of the Cerebration Series.</p>\n<p>The prompt to delve deeper into this was a case study on the need for running a state-wide school leadership development program in Kerala and the participants were asked to reflect on the following prompts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Who are the stakeholders whose agency should be restored in the process</li>\n<li>What are the barriers to the agency of these stakeholders</li>\n<li>What are the solutions and the program that will be designed towards leadership development, how will these enable restoring the agency of the stakeholders</li>\n</ol>\n<style>/*! elementor - v3.5.3 - 28-12-2021 */\n.elementor-heading-title{padding:0;margin:0;line-height:1}.elementor-widget-heading .elementor-heading-title[class*=elementor-size-]>a{color:inherit;font-size:inherit;line-height:inherit}.elementor-widget-heading .elementor-heading-title.elementor-size-small{font-size:15px}.elementor-widget-heading .elementor-heading-title.elementor-size-medium{font-size:19px}.elementor-widget-heading .elementor-heading-title.elementor-size-large{font-size:29px}.elementor-widget-heading .elementor-heading-title.elementor-size-xl{font-size:39px}.elementor-widget-heading .elementor-heading-title.elementor-size-xxl{font-size:59px}</style>\n<h4>Reflections from the group</h4>\n<style>/*! elementor - v3.5.3 - 28-12-2021 */\n.elementor-widget-image{text-align:center}.elementor-widget-image a{display:inline-block}.elementor-widget-image a img[src$=\".svg\"]{width:48px}.elementor-widget-image img{vertical-align:middle;display:inline-block}</style>\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"441\" height=\"468\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Stakeholders-in-focus-identified.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Stakeholders-in-focus-identified.png 441w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Stakeholders-in-focus-identified-283x300.png 283w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Stakeholders in focus identified</p>\n<p>The participants called out stakeholders right from the level of the schools to the senior-most layer of the education system including the school headmasters, cluster resource persons, block and district-level officials, and the state level institutions that focus on leadership development in the system. The thought as shared by all participants being that since one actor is connected to and influenced by the other, they all play key roles in a state-wide school leadership development program.</p>\n<h4>Barriers to agency<br />\n</h4>\n<p>When planning for a state-wide initiative, there could be several factors that become a barrier to the agency of the stakeholders. Some of these factors as called out by the participants were lack of clarity of what is expected, lack of match between the actual needs of the leaders and what is being assumed as the need, the newness of the program and lack of open channels to communicate the needs and challenges to name a few.</p>\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"469\" height=\"484\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Barriers-to-the-agency-of-the-stakeholders-identified-A.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Barriers-to-the-agency-of-the-stakeholders-identified-A.png 469w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Barriers-to-the-agency-of-the-stakeholders-identified-A-291x300.png 291w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Barriers to the agency of the stakeholders identified (A) </p>\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"530\" height=\"479\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Barriers-to-the-agency-of-the-stakeholders-identified-B.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Barriers-to-the-agency-of-the-stakeholders-identified-B.png 530w, http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Barriers-to-the-agency-of-the-stakeholders-identified-B-300x271.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n<p>Barriers to the agency of the stakeholders identified (B) </p>\n<h4>How do we design our program such that it restores agency?</h4>\n<p>Once the stakeholders and the barriers to their agency were called out, it was important to take into account these barriers in designing the solutions that will enable agency within the boundaries of the program. One of the key points that stood out across teams was the need to involve the stakeholders in the design process right from the stage of vision-setting, and create open channels of communication to share experiences, expectations and challenges so that there is cross learning and co-creation as a whole. The experience of coming together to design in a small group would lead to authentic voices being heard and will see higher ownership among the actors.</p>\n<p>From the discussion that followed this activity, it was evident that agency to be restored at scale cannot be a one-size fits all model, the only way agency can be restored at scale is when different contexts are taken into consideration and the system is capacitated to handle the surge of asks and expectations that will come once agency is restored.</p>\n<p>In the programs that you design for your stakeholders, have you factored in how the new process enables their agency? Share with us your experience of having conversations around agency with your stakeholders!</p>\n",

Schools continue to be closed and the entire system of educationists, practitioners and implementers, around the world, are up and running in finding ways to re-establish the  strong connection between the child and the teacher. This social distancing time has challenged all of us in our pursuit to support education interventions for all children.</p>\n<p>Constant efforts are being made in terms of learning, adapting and innovation to fill in the gaps that the Covid-19 pandemic has created. Towards the same cause, ShikshaLokam came up with the initiative:</p>\n<p><em>“Learn from home &#8211; A call for Collective”</em>, that spanned over 6 weeks. The goal of this initiative was to explore how we as a collective of civil-society organizations could work hand in hand to understand the key problems of our stakeholders and build end to end solutions for the same.</p>\n<p>This Collective was formed with the objective of enabling continuous learning and minimizing learning loss in wake of COVID-19. In the collective, the organizations shared, learnt and co-created solutions as a group and discussed working towards creating a prototype, which were relevant for their stakeholders in the current times. This initiative was also formed for organizations to support each other and realize the power of community.</p>\n<p>As a takeaway from this six weeks learning journey, the Collective decided to identify ways in which they can directly involve stakeholders in the ideation and ways in which strong prototypes creation and testing can be done.</p>\n<h2>Tags</h2>\n<h2>Recommended for you</h2>\n<article>\n                        <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/06/10/voices-of-cerebration-exploring-platform-values/\"></a><br />\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Voices-of-Cerebration-Exploring-Platform-Values-Featured-images-300x180.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<header>\n<h2><a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/06/10/voices-of-cerebration-exploring-platform-values/\" title=\"Voices of Cerebration: Exploring Platform Values\">Voices of Cerebration: Exploring Platform Values</a></h2>\n</header>\n<p>                    <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/author/shikshalokam/\" title=\"Posts by ShikshaLokam\" rel=\"author\">ShikshaLokam</a><time datetime=\"June 10, 2021\">June 10, 2021</time><br />\n    </article>\n<article>\n                        <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/20/voices-of-cerebration-exploring-interactions-in-the-system/\"></a><br />\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Carving-Featued-images-1-300x144.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<header>\n<h2><a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/20/voices-of-cerebration-exploring-interactions-in-the-system/\" title=\"Carving Opportunities in Crises\">Carving Opportunities in Crises</a></h2>\n</header>\n<p>                    <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/author/shikshalokam/\" title=\"Posts by ShikshaLokam\" rel=\"author\">ShikshaLokam</a><time datetime=\"May 20, 2021\">May 20, 2021</time><br />\n    </article>\n<article>\n                        <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/20/how-can-schools-use-data/\"></a><br />\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/How-can-Schools-use-Data-1-300x170.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<header>\n<h2><a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/20/how-can-schools-use-data/\" title=\"How can Schools use Data\">How can Schools use Data</a></h2>\n</header>\n<p>                    <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/author/shikshalokam/\" title=\"Posts by ShikshaLokam\" rel=\"author\">ShikshaLokam</a><time datetime=\"May 20, 2021\">May 20, 2021</time><br />\n    </article>\n",

Whether it is about the kind of engagement that we are able to build on our social media posts, or about the data showing the realities of the current health crisis that we are in, data has the power to lift us from tough situations and encourage us to act.  As we know, student enrollment in government schools is a challenge that spreads across all contexts in our country and the situation is becoming challenging in the current Covid scenario all the more. Every year, school leaders in coordination with the state’s department of education take innovative initiatives to ensure that the public education system reaches the maximum number of students in the country. A unique initiative that was taken up by the Government of Delhi to enable school leaders strengthen the trust of the community in the government schooling system was the School development Index Program. The program was an assessment-led improvement program, and the focus was to empower school leaders through data, with the thought that improvement-initiatives in government schools would encourage parents from the community to enroll their children in the schools.</p>\n<p>The program involved large scale school assessments for measuring the performance of schools on parameters like school safety and security, teaching and learning, social inclusion and community engagement. These assessments were a deviation from the regular pen-paper mode and were executed using the assessments capability on ShikshaLokam platform. The results of these assessments were made available to the respective school leaders. The next step to the assessments was creating individual action plans towards school improvement. The schools, depending upon the levels achieved across the parameters, created action plans for the areas that they wanted to improve first. The assessment-led improvement approach, in a lot of schools, led to the conduct of periodic school safety walks where school staff, and representatives from parent and student community took part periodically. This further led to creation of strategies to improve the level of safety in the school. This initiative saw participation of school leaders, members from the community and the students also, bringing each of them closer to the identity of their own schools.</p>\n<p>Conventionally there are limited opportunities for stakeholders to interact with their own data that can help them decide actionable in their work, within their context. Through the School Index program, the school leaders were empowered to use their own data to take informed decisions towards school improvement. Do such opportunities exist where you think your stakeholders can use data to shape their work, share with us!</p>\n<section></section>\n<h2>Tags</h2>\n<h2>Recommended for you</h2>\n<article>\n                        <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/06/10/voices-of-cerebration-exploring-platform-values/\"></a><br />\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Voices-of-Cerebration-Exploring-Platform-Values-Featured-images-300x180.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<header>\n<h2><a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/06/10/voices-of-cerebration-exploring-platform-values/\" title=\"Voices of Cerebration: Exploring Platform Values\">Voices of Cerebration: Exploring Platform Values</a></h2>\n</header>\n<p>                    <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/author/shikshalokam/\" title=\"Posts by ShikshaLokam\" rel=\"author\">ShikshaLokam</a><time datetime=\"June 10, 2021\">June 10, 2021</time><br />\n    </article>\n<article>\n                        <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/20/voices-of-cerebration-exploring-interactions-in-the-system/\"></a><br />\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Carving-Featued-images-1-300x144.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<header>\n<h2><a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/20/voices-of-cerebration-exploring-interactions-in-the-system/\" title=\"Carving Opportunities in Crises\">Carving Opportunities in Crises</a></h2>\n</header>\n<p>                    <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/author/shikshalokam/\" title=\"Posts by ShikshaLokam\" rel=\"author\">ShikshaLokam</a><time datetime=\"May 20, 2021\">May 20, 2021</time><br />\n    </article>\n<article>\n                        <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/07/why-school-leadership-matters/\"></a><br />\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Why-School-Leadership-Matters-300x187.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<header>\n<h2><a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/07/why-school-leadership-matters/\" title=\"Why School Leadership Matters\">Why School Leadership Matters</a></h2>\n</header>\n<p>                    <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/author/shikshalokam/\" title=\"Posts by ShikshaLokam\" rel=\"author\">ShikshaLokam</a><time datetime=\"May 7, 2021\">May 7, 2021</time><br />\n    </article>\n",

Program teams spend a lot of time in creating the most relevant set of resources and the implementation teams try their best to ensure that the stakeholders adopt the tools and learnings from the resources.</p>\n<p>In the open source platform space, such as ShikshaLokam, by design, whenever a creator creates a learning resource or an observation form or an improvement project on the platform, it becomes openly available for others to use as-is or to contextualize and innovate on top of that.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>A <strong>public good</strong> is a <strong>good</strong> that is both non-excludable (no one can be prevented from consuming this <strong>good</strong>) and non-rivalrous (the consumption of this <strong>good</strong> by anyone does not reduce the quantity available to others).</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One such example is the course for School Management Committees (SMCs) that was created on the platform. While a set of resources, created in English language,  was put together detailing the roles and responsibilities of SMCs towards school improvement, this single course was leveraged by different organizations for their programs. We saw this resource get translated to Hindi, Kannada and Tamil, being used for programs across states such as Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Haryana.</p>\n<p>While this was an example that showed the reusability and public good nature of the solutions on the platform, its mode of access also saw the same trend. Accessing resources via an embedded QR code as per periodic stakeholder activity saw great acceptance across programs &#8211; be it for Cluster Resource Persons in Karnataka or for School Management Committees and Head Masters in Tamil Nadu.</p>\n<p>Do you have examples manifesting the value of building public goods, share with us!</p>\n<section></section>\n<h2>Tags</h2>\n<h2>Recommended for you</h2>\n<article>\n                        <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/06/10/voices-of-cerebration-exploring-platform-values/\"></a><br />\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Voices-of-Cerebration-Exploring-Platform-Values-Featured-images-300x180.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<header>\n<h2><a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/06/10/voices-of-cerebration-exploring-platform-values/\" title=\"Voices of Cerebration: Exploring Platform Values\">Voices of Cerebration: Exploring Platform Values</a></h2>\n</header>\n<p>                    <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/author/shikshalokam/\" title=\"Posts by ShikshaLokam\" rel=\"author\">ShikshaLokam</a><time datetime=\"June 10, 2021\">June 10, 2021</time><br />\n    </article>\n<article>\n                        <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/20/voices-of-cerebration-exploring-interactions-in-the-system/\"></a><br />\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Carving-Featued-images-1-300x144.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<header>\n<h2><a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/20/voices-of-cerebration-exploring-interactions-in-the-system/\" title=\"Carving Opportunities in Crises\">Carving Opportunities in Crises</a></h2>\n</header>\n<p>                    <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/author/shikshalokam/\" title=\"Posts by ShikshaLokam\" rel=\"author\">ShikshaLokam</a><time datetime=\"May 20, 2021\">May 20, 2021</time><br />\n    </article>\n<article>\n                        <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/20/how-can-schools-use-data/\"></a><br />\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/How-can-Schools-use-Data-1-300x170.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<header>\n<h2><a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/20/how-can-schools-use-data/\" title=\"How can Schools use Data\">How can Schools use Data</a></h2>\n</header>\n<p>                    <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/author/shikshalokam/\" title=\"Posts by ShikshaLokam\" rel=\"author\">ShikshaLokam</a><time datetime=\"May 20, 2021\">May 20, 2021</time><br />\n    </article>\n",

            "rendered": "<h3>Carving Opportunities in Crises</h3>\n<h4>Catalysing Interactions between Parents community and the School</h4>\n<p>During the first wave of Covid- 19 when the schools were getting closed &#8211; the students, parents as well as teachers were struggling to make sense of how teaching-learning will continue ..Will everyone have to move to online learning, what about the children who do not have access to mobile devices and internet connections, what about the teachers who are used to traditional methods of teaching and how to help them familiarize with tech-based teaching methods, with so many such questions looming, it became increasingly difficult to find a silver lining in between all this.  </p>\n<p>Amidst this chaos, the Punjab State Education Department took an initiative to reach out to the parents and children themselves. The Department in collaboration with the education collective in Punjab started and ran a series of Virtual Parents Teachers meetings to build trust with the community and parents to assure them that in such times of uncertainty, the Department is still committed to the education of the children.</p>\n<p>Virtual Parents Teachers Meeting (VPTM) emerged as an effective means to energize the connection that the Department shares with the parent community. Every VPTM saw teachers and school leaders connecting with the parent community of their respective schools where the parents shared their whereabouts, their queries and concerns and the teachers shared latest information on how the department is aiming to address those concerns. The idea was to make the interaction between parents and school staff come alive as that was one way of making sure that all stakeholders stay connected and involved in such tough times. Parents of around 21 lakhs students were connected with, to inform them about the initiatives such as online education through the television and related post work for students, to hear out their  concerns and feedback, and to appreciate the efforts that they are taking with their children and the schools  to ensure continued education.</p>\n<p>This initiative gained a lot of success in the State and continues to be organized continuously across multiple quarters of the academic year. As critical stakeholders in the education of a child, the education system and the parent community do not interact with each other at the scale and as frequently as it might be useful. Coming together of these actors in the time of pandemic was extremely reassuring for everyone involved. This in many ways manifested the societal platform core value of catalyzing interactions, that points out how interactions between key stakeholders hold the power of addressing immediate and relevant challenges of everyone involved, and overall brings in more trust and agency in the system.</p>\n<h2>Tags</h2>\n<h2>Recommended for you</h2>\n<article>\n                        <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/06/10/voices-of-cerebration-exploring-platform-values/\"></a><br />\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Voices-of-Cerebration-Exploring-Platform-Values-Featured-images-300x180.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<header>\n<h2><a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/06/10/voices-of-cerebration-exploring-platform-values/\" title=\"Voices of Cerebration: Exploring Platform Values\">Voices of Cerebration: Exploring Platform Values</a></h2>\n</header>\n<p>                    <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/author/shikshalokam/\" title=\"Posts by ShikshaLokam\" rel=\"author\">ShikshaLokam</a><time datetime=\"June 10, 2021\">June 10, 2021</time><br />\n    </article>\n<article>\n                        <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/20/voices-of-cerebration-exploring-interactions-in-the-system/\"></a><br />\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Carving-Featued-images-1-300x144.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<header>\n<h2><a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/20/voices-of-cerebration-exploring-interactions-in-the-system/\" title=\"Carving Opportunities in Crises\">Carving Opportunities in Crises</a></h2>\n</header>\n<p>                    <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/author/shikshalokam/\" title=\"Posts by ShikshaLokam\" rel=\"author\">ShikshaLokam</a><time datetime=\"May 20, 2021\">May 20, 2021</time><br />\n    </article>\n<article>\n                        <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/20/how-can-schools-use-data/\"></a><br />\n                            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http://localhost/societalplatform/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/How-can-Schools-use-Data-1-300x170.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<header>\n<h2><a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/2021/05/20/how-can-schools-use-data/\" title=\"How can Schools use Data\">How can Schools use Data</a></h2>\n</header>\n<p>                    <a href=\"https://shikshalokam.org/author/shikshalokam/\" title=\"Posts by ShikshaLokam\" rel=\"author\">ShikshaLokam</a><time datetime=\"May 20, 2021\">May 20, 2021</time><br />\n    </article>\n",
